- Versions and keeping up to date

## Component

### Component intro

- Event handling
- Control flow @if, @for, @switch

### Component communication

- @Input() and @Output
- Two way data binding
  - npm ng generate component pick-coffee/coffee-input
  - add inputs and outputs to coffee-input
  - add one-way data binding
  - change one-way data binding to two way data binding
  - npm ng generate component pick-coffee/coffee-list
- Avoiding methods in templates
  - create method calls from template
  - refactor inside pick-coffee/coffee-input using setters/getters
  - refactor inside pick-coffee/coffee-input using ngOnChanges

## Pipes

- Custom pipe
  - npm ng generate pipe totalPrice
- Common pipes
  - use decimal pipe to all prices

## Forms

### Template driven forms

- One field form
  - add one field input to coffee-input component with validation
- Multiple field form and submit
  - npm ng generate component order-coffee/order-overview
  - create shared directory and move files
  - add simple order overview form
  - add validations
  - add validation messages
  - add optional email

### Reactive forms

- Multiple field form and submit
  - npm ng generate component registration/registration-form

## Dependency injection

### Http and singleton services

- Setup server
  - npm i -D json-server
  - create server.json
  - update npm scripts
- Setup http

  - inject HttpClient using c# constructor, primary constructor, inject function
- What is an observable (pipeline)
- Get data and manually subscribe
  - manually subscribe with unsubscribe
  - manually subscribe with takeUntil
  - manually subscribe with takeUntilDestroyed

### State management

- Creating singleton service
  - npm run ng generate service core/coffee-store
- State management using singleton service
  - save orderedCoffees using subject
  - save orderedCoffees using signal
- Facades
  - npm run ng generate service core/coffee-facade
